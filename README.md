# 2.5D_Platformer_Pro
A 2.5D Platformer game made using Unity2019.4.34f1 from a class game. It's being made
in the 3D space but will be converted to a more of a 2D game. The following controls
will control the player character.

CONTROLS: Keyboard and Mouse controls. A = left, D = right, Space = jump

The player will jump from platform to platform and collect coins. The UI will have a
2D graphic for the player's lives and also for the coins the player collects.
